SUMMARY ðŸ‘¾

This is a 2D game about a blue blob. Your goal is to get to the exit of each level and complete the game. Sounds easy, but there's a catch. You're in space and once you move, you cannot stop or change direction until you hit an obstacle. These obstacles vary in strength and weight, allowing you to interact with your environment.

CONTROLS:

WASD: move character.

Escape: exit game.

Shift: load next level.

Control: load previous level

R: reload current level

Blocks:

Exit: I don't think this one needs an explanation

Brick Wall: a simple wall you can bounce against: that's all

Cracked Wall: a brittle version of the brick wall, breaks after one hit

Slime Block: Very bouncy, don't expect to stay on course after hitting this block

Crate: It's a regular block, just slightly lighter. Try bumping into this one

Portal: Will sent you flying out of another portal with a similar colour
